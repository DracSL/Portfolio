                <h3>Consider the Peafowl</h3>
                <img src="img/pea.png" alt="peafowl">

                <p>So there I was, lounging in thought today, flipping through some quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore. As I delved into the recesses of memory, an anecdote from ancient Rome, one that had long intrigued me, bubbled to the surface. I found myself unable to pinpoint its source—was it Lucullus? Perhaps Caesonius? My mind wandered to a famous gardener, renowned for his lavish lifestyle. He had supposedly kept a grand game reserve where, on command, an actor, dressed as Orpheus, would strum a tune, and lo and behold, all manner of beasts would gather, enchanted by his melody—just like in the legends. Of course, in reality, the animals had merely been trained to associate the actor's singing with feeding time, a clever illusion of Orphic power.</p>
        
                <p>Martial’s <i>On Spectacles</i> (Liber Spectaculorum), written to celebrate the grand opening of the Colosseum, came to mind. In one of the epigrams (XXI), Martial paints a vivid, if rather macabre, scene:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Every kind of wild beast was there, mixed in the herd, and above the Orpheus, many birds hovered—but he fell, mauled by an ungrateful bear. This was the only thing which did not correspond to the legend."</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>A typically brutal, martial depiction from Martial. The spectacle he describes, where a prisoner is executed while dressed as Orpheus, was not quite the pastoral scene I had recalled. My curiosity piqued, I embarked on a search for the source of my memory. Hours were spent rifling through the works of Plutarch and both Plinys, the Elder and the Younger. Finally, I found it—nestled in the pages of Varro's <i>De Re Rustica</i> (On Agriculture), Book 3, Chapter 13. It seemed fitting that the anecdote would come from Varro, the original Roman expert on all things animal husbandry.</p>
        
                <p>In this passage, Varro recounts a conversation between Appius and Axius:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"You know, Axius," Appius continued, "that boars can be kept in the warren with no great trouble; and that both those that have been caught and the tame ones which are born there commonly grow fat in them. For on the place that our friend Varro here bought from Marcus Pupius Piso near Tusculum, you saw wild boars and roes gather for food at the blowing of a horn at a regular time, when mast was thrown from a platform above to the boars, and vetch or the like to the roes."</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>But that’s not all—Appius then describes a similar spectacle at Quintus Hortensius's estate near Laurentum:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Why," said he, "I saw it carried out more in the Thracian fashion at Quintus Hortensius's place near Laurentum when I was there. For there was a forest which covered, he said, more than fifty <i>iugera</i> (about 12.6 hectares or 31.2 acres), it was enclosed with a wall, and he called it, not a warren, but a game-preserve. In it was a high spot where was spread the table at which we were dining, to which he bade Orpheus be called. When he appeared with his robe and harp, and was bidden to sing, he blew a horn; whereupon there poured around us such a crowd of stags, boars, and other animals that it seemed to me to be no less attractive a sight than when the hunts of the aediles take place in the Circus Maximus without the African beasts."</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>Here was the spectacle I had remembered! Hortensius, a man known for his opulence, had indeed staged an Orphean fantasy, complete with a forest full of obedient wildlife. Cicero once remarked that Hortensius was a "fishpond-fancier," spending lavishly on his gardens, ponds, and, most famously, his cuisine.</p>
        
                <p>It is to Hortensius, according to Varro, that Rome owes the introduction of the peafowl to its culinary repertoire—a delicacy that quickly became, as Grandpa Simpson might say, "the style of the time." But what caught my attention more than the peafowl's gastronomic ascent was the staggering prices listed by Varro:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"It is said that Quintus Hortensius was the first to serve these fowl; it was on the occasion of his inauguration as aedile, and the innovation was praised at that time rather by the luxurious than by those who were strict and virtuous. As his example was quickly followed by many, the price has risen to such a point that the eggs sell for five denarii each, the birds themselves sell readily for 50 each, and a flock of 100 easily brings 40,000 sesterces — in fact, Abuccius used to say that if one required three chicks to every hen, the total might amount to 60,000."</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>What exactly was the value of 50 denarii in today’s terms? Calculating the purchasing power of historical currencies is fraught with challenges, but as a rough rule of thumb, one denarius is often equated to 15-25 Euros. A low-skilled worker in Rome would earn about one denarius per day, so owning a peafowl in the first century BC would have been akin to spending over 1,000 Euros—or about a month and a half’s salary. Clearly, this was a meal meant to showcase wealth like no other!</p>
        
                <p>Today, in Europe, a peafowl costs about 50 Euros—a far cry from its ancient price. It seems we’ve lost our taste for the decadent showmanship that the Romans both reveled in and criticized.</p>
        
                <p>In Petronius’s <i>Satyricon</i>, we find a poignant commentary on this excess:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"The high walls of Mars crumble beneath the gaping jaws of luxurious gluttony. To please thy palate, the peacock in his Babylonian vesture of gilded feathers is imprisoned and fed."</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>This brings us back to Martial, who, although he failed me in my search for Orphic spectacles, provides a biting critique of the Roman palate in his <i>Epigrams</i> (Book XIV). Alongside his famous note on flamingo tongues, he offers his opinion on the peafowl:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Lost in admiration, you marvel when he spreads his feathers, and yet, you savage, hand him to the cook?"</p>
                </blockquote>
        
                <p>Indeed, bon appétit.</p>
        
                <p>Throughout the history of cuisine, one common thread persists: the higher up the food chain, the more parasites one accumulates, and yet, there are always exceptions. An arachnologist once showed me photographs of Laotian natives capturing binturongs from the jungle for their meals. I even know of a German restaurant that occasionally serves brown bear. During the siege of Paris in 1870, when food supplies dwindled, the city’s last luxuries were the animals of the menagerie—elephant soup and wolf were on the menu.</p>
        
                <p>As for the taste of peafowl, my Roman sources are unanimous. In Horace’s <i>Satires</i> (Book 2), he wryly observes:</p>
        
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Nevertheless, I will not be able to dissuade you from rubbing your palate on peacock rather than chicken. Wherefore? Corrupted by the vanity of things, the rare bird is paid in gold and parades with its unfurled spectacular tail—as if that makes any difference? You do not eat the beautiful feathers; what do you praise when cooked? You are deceived by strange forms—for chicken and peacock’s flesh is equal in its taste. It is only your vain eye that guides the judgment of your tongue. But so be it!"</p>

                <img src="img/panther.png" alt="panther">
                <p>     </p>
                <p>There is a common misconception that grand animal collections started in the West due to colonialism. In spite of that when America was colonized in the 15th century the world's largest wild animal collection wasn’t in Europe. Sure, there were impressive collections like the Tower Menagerie, the Lion House in Lisbon, and several smaller Wunderkammern and menageries scattered across European courts. But all of these were dwarfed in sheer size by the collection housed in Moctezuma’s palace in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City). We also have evidence of pre-European animal collections in other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Mayans (Copán around 700 CE) and Teotihuacan (500 CE).</p>

                <p>So, what were the preconditions for the first European collections? It correlates to the emergence of seafaring nations and international trade. The Age of Exploration was partly fueled by the fall of Constantinople in 1453. After the Ottomans captured the city, Europeans needed a new way to obtain the valuable goods from China and India. With the Silk Road effectively closed, they had to get creative. The Portuguese established a trade route via West Africa to India. Dürer’s famous engraving of the Rhinoceros dates from 1515, and this is no coincidence. The Indian rhinoceros that served as the model for Dürer’s piece arrived in Lisbon thanks to this newly established trade route. Economic necessity drove these expeditions, and only with these new trade routes did the exotic animal trade—an important source of political pride for European rulers—begin to expand.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the Spaniards, trying to reach India via the West, severely miscalculated the Earth’s circumference and stumbled upon an entirely new continent. A true story of failing upwards! The silver and gold from the New World made Spain incredibly wealthy, and could you imagine modern cuisine without pepper, paprika, corn, potatoes, and tomatoes?</p>

                <p>When the Conquistadores entered Tenochtitlan in 1519, they were awestruck by the grandeur and splendor of the city. Entire chapters have been written about Moctezuma’s palace complex, with much attention devoted to the animal collection. Three primary sources come to mind: Sahagún’s 'Florentine Codex' (The Universal History of the Things of New Spain), Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s 'The True Account of the Conquest of New Spain,' and Antonio de Solís’ 'The History of the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards.'</p>

                <p>A little rant before we dive into the Florentine Codex: Trying to understand early modern Spanish is a nightmare because the language was written phonetically. You have to read it aloud to grasp what they were trying to convey. For example, you might read “yervas crudas,” which doesn’t make sense at first. But if you say it out loud, you realize it’s how they pronounced “hierbas crudas” (raw herbs). So, why do I bother reading the original texts despite the headaches? Because there’s a lot of nonsense in secondary accounts, and you can’t trust a source unless you’re familiar with the primary texts. Regarding the Aztec menagerie, I’ve seen writers claim it housed everything from hummingbirds to monkeys, sloths, and sea lions—none of which I found in the original sources.</p>

                <p>Still with me? Let’s get into the text. Book 8 of the Florentine Codex is about the upper class. On page 158, it begins:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"Another hall is called Totocalli (Nahuatl, literally 'bird house'), where a superintendent guarded all kinds of different birds, like eagles and other birds they named Tlauhquechol (Nahuatl: roseate spoonbill), parrots, turkey vultures [...]" <br>
                ("Otra sala se llamana Totocalli, donde estavá unos mayordomos, que guardavan todo genero de aves, como agujlas, y otros paxarotes, que se llaman Tlauhquechol [...] y papaga yos, y coxoliti [..].")</p></blockquote>

                <p>The list of fowl continues for the rest of the page.</p>

                <p>A page later, we find the carnivore house:</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>“There are tigers, lions, oncas, and serval cats.” <br>
                ("hax tigres, y leones, y oncas, y gatos cervales")</p></blockquote>

                <p>I chose the Florentine Codex because it’s bilingual. The Nahuatl text is more accurate: "Ocelotl, Cuetlachtli, Miztli, ocotochtli."</p>

                <p>So, the “tigers” are jaguars, the “lions” are wolves, the “oncas” are cougars, and the “serval cats” are lynx. If you paid close attention, you might have learned that "Ocelot" is literally the Aztec word for "Jaguar"—we’ve been using it incorrectly! By the way, "ocotochtli" means pine rabbit and can refer to anything from a lynx to a marten or even a kinkajou. However, I know that "gato cervales" (deer’s cat) was used in the Iberian Peninsula 500 years ago for the lynx.</p>

                <p>It might be amusing to think the Spaniards mistook a wolf for a lion, but we have more confirmation from Díaz del Castillo:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"In another large building, numerous idols were erected, said to be the most terrible of all their gods. Near these were kept all manner of beautiful animals, tigers, lions of two different kinds—one shaped like a wolf, called a jackal—along with foxes and other small beasts of prey. Most of these animals had been bred here and were fed on wild deer’s flesh, turkeys, dogs, and sometimes, as I have been assured, on the offal of human beings."</p> </blockquote>

                <p>The “lions of two different kinds” were, of course, the wolf and the coyote, and Díaz del Castillo thought only the coyote resembled a wolf. Go figure.</p>

                <p>According to Díaz del Castillo, another house was dedicated to reptiles, where he particularly emphasized the presence of rattlesnakes bred there.</p>

                <p>Regarding the bird house, he wrote:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"Motecuhzoma had likewise a variety of aviaries, and it is indeed with difficulty that I restrain myself from going into too much detail about them. I will confine myself to stating that we saw every kind of eagle, from the king’s eagle to the smallest species, and every type of bird, from the largest known to the tiny birds with green, shining feathers in their full splendor. These birds, very much resembling our Spanish magpies in size, are called by the Indians quezales. The species of sparrows were particularly curious, having five distinct colors in their plumage—green, red, white, yellow, and blue; I have, however, forgotten their Mexican name. There were vast numbers of parrots and many species, such that I cannot recall all their names, along with geese of the richest plumage and other large birds. These birds were periodically stripped of their feathers to allow new ones to grow. All these birds had appropriate places to breed and were under the care of several Indians of both sexes, who kept the nests clean, provided each kind its proper food, and set the birds to breed. In the courtyard belonging to this building, there was a large basin of fresh water, where, besides other waterfowl, there was a particularly beautiful bird with long legs, its body, wings, and tail variously colored. It is called the ipiris in Cuba, where it is also found."</p></blockquote>

                <p>Quetzals well-cared for? That’s impressive even by today’s standards. Modern American and European zoos still haven't quite figured out how to keep them alive.</p>

                <p>Now, let’s turn to de Solís:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"These birds were so numerous, and the care of preserving them was so great, that it employed over three hundred men, skilled in the knowledge of their diseases and obliged to supply them with the food they were accustomed to eat in the wild."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Three hundred zookeepers for the birds alone! De Solís also mentions a separate house for birds of prey, courtyards with pools and singing birds, and other beasts not mentioned in the other accounts, such as bears, crocodiles, and an animal called the “Mexican bull,” which, by its description, is a bison:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"a wonderful composition of diverse animals. It has crooked shoulders, with a hump on its back like a camel; its flanks dry, its tail large, and its neck covered with hair like a lion. It is cloven-footed, its head armed like that of a bull, which it resembles in fierceness, with no less strength and agility."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The natural range of the American bison was 1,000 km to the North from Tenochtitlan. The resplendent quetzal natural habitat was 1,000km to the South. It was an impressive animal collection, with creatures from across the entire empire. Nothing in Europe could compare to the Aztec menagerie. For example, the prided Barbary lions of the Lisbon court were only 500 kilometers from their native range.</p>
                <p>So, why this much ado about nothing? Because the implication that Europe’s animal collections were established when Europe colonized America is wrong. It’s the other way around. Exploration and colonization sprouted the exotic animal collections. However, the early Iberian colonization lacked the scientific rigor that would later define animal collections — it was primarily about getting as much gold as possible to Spain and a myriad of sexually transmitted diseases for the conquistadores.</p>
                <p>We had to wait for the Age of Enlightenment, and with it, Linnaeus’s 'gonna catch them all' Systema Naturae, to get to what we now recognize as “real zoos.” The Enlightenment brought about the French Revolution, and after some heads rolled, the menagerie of Versailles was moved to Paris in 1793. The Vienna Menagerie had already been open to the public since 1778. These were the baby steps of Europe’s first zoos. By this time, the United States was already independent, and Mexico would gain its independence in 1821.</p>
            
                <p>The oldest zoo to actually call itself a "zoo" was London’s, founded in 1828—just seven years after Mexican independence. Now, let's dive into some linguistics. The word "menagerie" is a French term used by kings and those who aspired to imitate them, linking it directly to the absolutism of the 18th century. Not exactly a term that evokes progress. On the other hand, "zoo" is derived from Greek, a nod to the scientific and classical heritage of Aristotle, the "father" of zoology. The term "zoo" feels bourgeois, scientific, and modern—a far cry from the dusty old absolutism of menageries. In short, while "menagerie" reeks of outdated absolutism, "zoo" represents a new, modern approach to nature.</p>
                <p>The modern zoo is essentially a 19th-century invention, designed to educate the public about science. Early zoos were systematic, organizing animals by species rather than geography, unlike the more geographically themed zoos we see today. However there is a problem for a great systematic collection: France and England, they were already empires. As we all know, success makes lazy. They sourced all the animals from the boundaries of their empires.</p>
                <p>As a small example: the first living axolotls came to Europe in 1866 - why? France decided to invade Mexico in 1861.</p>
                <p>In Paris they founded the garden of acclimatization. A park with the sole purpose of acclimating the animals and plants from the colonies of the empire to the French climate. </p>

                <p>This is where a new challenger apporached: Germany is a relatively young country, having been founded as a nation-state in 1871. If you think of 19th-century Germany, it’s somewhat like how China is viewed today—a densely populated manufacturing powerhouse, producing goods that are cheaper but still of good quality. Germany was also eager to prove itself, often sabre-rattling to be taken seriously by older, more established powers. The country had a lot of unresolved grudges from the time when it wasn’t quite on par with the rest of Europe, and it was desperate to prove itself in competition with other nations.</p>

                <p>In this context, having numerous zoos became a point of national pride for Germany—a form of "cultural victory." While France and England sourced their animals from their vast empires, Germany had to get creative. This led to the establishment of its own animal trading companies. Instead of relying on London for Asian elephants, Germans could say, "Forget that, it’s too expensive—let’s send Hans to Sumatra and buy them directly." Without an empire of its own, Germany’s trading companies were forced to build networks around the globe. Hagenbeck and Ruhe KG eventually became the two largest exotic animal trade companies in the world.</p>

                <p>Another advantage for Germany was its political structure. Unlike France and the UK, which were centralized countries with one dominant capital, Germany was a federation with several strong cities, not just one major center. Naturally, every city that aspired to be sophisticated needed its own zoo.</p>

                <p>But what about America?</p>

                <p>I've always had the feeling that American zoos were closely connected to these German zoo empires. Many supporters of American zoos came from the vast German immigrant population. For example, in the 19th century, the Philadelphia Zoo even had German-language guides. Harry M. Wegeforth, the founder of the San Diego Zoo, was of German heritage. Although I don’t want to overstate this connection—since the earliest American zoos were also inspired by British models—there is certainly a link.</p>
                <p>Unlike Europe, where there was an "arms race" to build zoos in the 19th century, the United States had a different focus. While the East Coast of America was already "civilized," the Western part of the country was still frontier territory, not yet fully integrated into the nation. Settlers in the West lived close to nature, encountering wildlife daily. There was no need for the romantic longing for nature that characterized 19th-century Europe. The American man of the West lived a life immersed in nature— he didn’t need cages to remind him of what was just outside his door.</p>
